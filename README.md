The landing script is highly specific and while it should in theory work with most scenarios if you do not tune the conditions, marked in the code, correctly you'll get unsatisfactory results. For tuning values I'd suggest taking a look at https://www.amir-nadimi.ir/ there is some detailed telemetry for the Falcon 9 missions(including landing attempts).
